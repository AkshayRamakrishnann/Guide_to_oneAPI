# Intel oneAPI Optimized Code Examples Repository
Welcome to the Intel oneAPI Optimized Code Examples Repository! This repository contains optimized code examples that utilize various libraries from Intel's oneAPI toolkit. The three code files included in this repository demonstrate the usage of the following libraries:
oneDAL (oneAPI Data Analytics Library) - oneDAL.ipynb
oneDNN (oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library) - oneDNN.ipynb
XGBoost with oneAPI - XGB.ipynb

## About the Libraries
1. oneDAL (oneAPI Data Analytics Library)
The oneDAL.ipynb code file showcases the capabilities of the oneDAL library, which provides efficient data analysis and machine learning algorithms for a variety of use cases. Whether you're working on data preprocessing, linear algebra, statistical analysis, or machine learning tasks, oneDAL has you covered.

2. oneDNN (oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library)
In the oneDNN.ipynb code file, you'll find examples that leverage the oneDNN library, designed to accelerate deep learning workloads. This library offers optimized primitives for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and other deep learning models, enhancing both training and inference performance.

3. XGBoost with oneAPI
The XGB.ipynb code file demonstrates how to integrate the XGBoost library with oneAPI, leveraging the power of oneAPI's hardware acceleration. XGBoost is a popular machine learning library for gradient boosting on decision trees, and when combined with oneAPI's optimizations, it becomes even more efficient and powerful.
